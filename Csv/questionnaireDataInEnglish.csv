Maybe this could be a demand just mine, and not necessarily the course, CC teachers themselves give support to the students and some are practically '' parents '' in the institution this leaves the student closer and makes you have a support while a student. Finally, I wish good luck with CBT that can be successful and complete in the best way possible. Currently I am studying the 7th period of psychology (radical change) but today I am in the course. Perhaps one of the demands is to show the students the different areas of activity that the professional can act, besides lectures and ways to inform students where they are, in fact I felt very lost when I was there, but it is a much more demand for at the time I was very young and did not identify myself with the course, but having lectures, and information always about areas and related, besides the professional performance is one of the differentials, that would make the students decide earlier or not in relation to Computing .

PERSONAL RELEASE: While I was attending the undergraduate course in at least one semester, there was only one elective course that fit into a certain schedule (reserved for elective courses), the others that I could enroll had already been paid or collided schedule. This shows how limited the supply of electives was in the period I attended."
